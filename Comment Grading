Is it possible to add a feature that makes a count for comments on an assignment. One of the professors would like to see a holistic view of who has left comments on a given assignment, without looking at every image and writing a list of who commented. This could either be a generated list of all students who commented on a given assignment, or something like the Canvas discussion boards where you can search for a given student within the comments for an assignment.
